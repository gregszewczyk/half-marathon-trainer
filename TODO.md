## üìù Notes

### Adding New Items
When adding new todos, please:
1. Assign appropriate priority (High/Medium/Low)
2. Add brief description and context
3. Include date when item was identified
4. Move completed items to "Recently Completed" with completion date

### Priority Guidelines
- **High**: Bugs, security issues, broken functionality
- **Medium**: New features, UX improvements, performance optimizations  
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features, refactoring, cosmetic changes

### AI-Related Items
